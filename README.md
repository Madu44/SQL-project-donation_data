DESCRIPTION:
Situation: In a hypothetical situation as a Data Analyst working for a charity organization, EDUCATION FOR ALL. I have been asked by the Head of Fundraising to present data on donor insights and donation rates.

Task: The purpose of this report is to increase the number of donors in the database, Increase the donation frequency of the donors and Increase the value of donations in the database. Data given to me were datasets of EFO_Donation_Data and EFO_Donor_Data. 

Action: I uploaded the datasets in SQLite Online for analysis. I applied SQL commands like JOIN, ORDER BY, WHERE, BETWEEN, AND, OR, SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), GROUP BY, HAVING to analyze data. I used the data sets FOR_Donation_Data and FOR_Donor_Data to answer the business problem and finally created charts and dashboards using Tableau Public for visualizations. I have two weeks to work on this report.

Result: In my report, I used the 5 WHYâ€™s (Root Cause Analysis) to understand the problem and ask the right questions. As a result, I found out crucial insights from provided datasets, prepared visualizations, and report to my team.
