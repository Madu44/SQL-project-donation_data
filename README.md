In a hypothetical scenario as a Data Analyst working for a Charity organisation, I have been tasked by the Head of Fundraising to present data on donor insights and donation rates. Our objectives are to increase the number of donors in our database, increase the donation frequency of our donors, and increase the value of donations in our database. In two weeks, we have a fundraising strategy meeting and I need to present insights from the donation data to inform our fundraising strategy and increase donations.
